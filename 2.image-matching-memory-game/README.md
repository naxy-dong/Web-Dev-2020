# History
## 2020
I made this project back when I had no understanding of parameters and return type. My first version of this project was, needless to say, embarassing to look at because it contains more than 800+ lines of copy and pasting Javascript code. 
## 2022
Now I've more understanding about Javascript. I was able to shorten it to only 120 lines of Javascript code and fixed a lot of redundant information in HTML and Javascript.
