/*
	columns.css
	
	This file sets up a template for creating flowing columns on a web page.  In order use this file, you will need to define a column layout built within containers in the format:

		<tag class = "columncontainer">
			<tag class = "column">
				<tag class = "colcontent">
				</tag>
			</tag>
		</tag>
	
	The tags that you use for your design are unimportant as the css will redefine their styling.  Make sure they have the proper classnames.

	You may include as many columns as you like, or as many rows of columns as you like.  When defining a new row, you have the option of inserting a column divider (usually a styled <hr />).
*/

/*
	.columncontainer
	
	This class represents the overall container for the entire column layour.
	
	The container needs to be a centered block element with all items inside centered.  Setting a custom width for the individual file is encouraged.
*/
.columncontainer
{
	display:block;
	margin-left:auto;
	margin-right:auto;
	text-align:center;
}

/*
	.column
	
	This class defines the basic column.  The inline-block display gives us the flexibility to set a width for it and ensure that our columns will appear side by side in any resolution.  This is set for a 3 column display.
	
	The vertical-align brings all of the text within to the top of the column so there isn't a jagged edge up there.
	
	The padding of 2% puts a flexible amount of space between the columns so that they will be consistent in various resolutions.

.column
{
	display:inline-block;
	width:25%;
	vertical-align:top;
	padding:2%;
}

/*
	.colcontent
	
	This class must be a block element.  It has no defined style because all of that is based on the theme of the web page.
	
	This element may be omitted if it's not needed.  It may also be repeated multiple times if your column is split into multiple sections.
*/

.colcontent
{
	display:block;
}

/*
	.coldivider
	
	It is assumed (though not enforced) that this will be an <hr /> tag.

	Formatting an hr can be a nice way of dressing up the page.  Remember that an hr is a hollow rectangle that has been flattened into a line.  By changing the height, you can open it up and color it with a background color (this does not work in all browsers).  You can also trim it by setting borders.
	
	NOTE - THE STYLING OF <hr /> TAGS MAY VARY FROM BROWSER TO BROWSER.
